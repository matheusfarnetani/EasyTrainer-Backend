# Domain
## Domain Principles
- Entities must represent real business concepts with identity and behavior.
- Entities should be independent of any external frameworks (e.g., EF Core, Web libraries).
- Only domain-related logic belongs here â€” no database concerns, no API-specific code.
- Relationships are represented by navigation properties or dedicated relationship models.

## Value Objects (Optional for future)
- Value Objects represent attributes that do not have identity.
- Currently not used, but examples could include `Address`, `ContactInformation`, etc., if necessary in future domain expansions.

---
## Repositories Interfaces
All main domain models have their own repository and repository interface, following the generic repository pattern.

### Main Repositories Interfaces
- IUserRepository
- IInstructorRepository
- IGoalRepository
- ILevelRepository
- ITypeRepository
- IModalityRepository
- IHashtagRepository
- IWorkoutRepository
- IRoutineRepository
- IExerciseRepository

### Relationship Repositories Interfaces
- IRoutineHasExerciseRepository

### Notes
- Only `RoutineHasExercise` has a dedicated repository because it contains additional business attributes (order, sets, reps, rest time, notes, day, week, is_optional).
- All other relationship tables (simple many-to-many links) are handled through entity navigation and do not require separate repositories.

---
### Generic Repository
The **Generic Repository Pattern** is designed to provide a reusable set of data operations (CRUD) for different entities without duplicating code.

The logic behind it is:
- Define a **generic interface** `IRepository` that works with any entity type.
- Implement **standard CRUD operations** once, and reuse them for all entities.
- Extend the generic repository with **specific repositories** if you need custom queries (e.g., `GetUserByEmail`, `GetWorkoutsByUserId`).

**Benefits of using a Generic Repository:**
- Reduces code duplication by centralizing common CRUD operations.
- Ensures consistency across all data access layers.
- Simplifies maintenance by isolating data access logic.
- Facilitates scalability when adding new entities.
- Promotes separation of concerns between business logic and data persistence.
